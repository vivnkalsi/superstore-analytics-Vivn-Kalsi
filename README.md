## Superstore Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Superstore sales data using Python in Google Colab and compares the process with Excel. Key business insights such as Sales by Region, Profit Margin by Category, and Top Products were visualized and interpreted using pandas and seaborn. While Excel was quicker for creating basic pivot tables, Python offered more flexibility, automation, and deeper insights through code.
